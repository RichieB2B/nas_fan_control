# nas_fan_control
collection of scripts to control fan speed on NAS boxes

PID_fan_control.pl - Perl fan control script based on the hybrid fan control script created by @Stux, and posted at:
https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/script-hybrid-cpu-hd-fan-zone-controller.46159/ .  @Stux's script was modified by replacing his fan control loop with a PID controller.  This version of the script was modified to run on Linux, particularly my Proxmox server.

This version requires hddtemp to be installed on the host for reading the HDD temperatures.

The hard drive fans are connected to fan headers assigned to the hard drive temperature control portion of the script.  The chassis exit fans and the CPU cooler are connected to fan headers assigned to the CPU temperature control portion of the script.

See the scripts for more info and commentary.
